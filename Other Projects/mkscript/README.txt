mkscript - A program which will create script files from a template and prepare them for execution.

More additions still need to be made:
  -Make the script function as an inbuilt command.
  -Add some sort of helpfile functionality.
  -Add options to overwrite exsiting files or append a template to them.
  -Add support for multiple templates.
