#Instructions:
#In this exercise, you will need to change Warren Buffett's known saying.
#First create a variable ISAY and assign it the original saying value.
#Then re-assign it with a new changed value using the string operations and following the 4 defined changes:
#Change1: replace the first occurrence of 'snow' with 'foot'. Change2: delete the second occurrence of 'snow'.
#Change3: replace 'finding' with 'getting'. Change4: delete all characters following 'wet'.
#Tip: One way to implement Change4, if to find the index of 'w' in the word 'wet' and then use substring extraction.

#The original saying.
BUFFETT="Life is like a snowball. The important thing is finding wet snow and a really long hill."
# write your code here
#The saying to be modified.
ISAY="Life is like a snowball. The important thing is finding wet snow and a really long hill."

#Change1: Replace the first occurrence of 'snow' with 'foot'.
ISAY=${ISAY[@]/snow/foot}
#Change2: Delete the second occurrence of 'snow'.
ISAY=${ISAY[@]/snow/}
#Change3: Replace 'finding' with 'getting'.
ISAY=${ISAY[@]/finding/getting}

#Finding the location of 'wet'.
wLocation=$((`expr index "$ISAY" "w"` + 2))
#Making a substring that holds everything after 'wet'.
toBeRemoved=${ISAY:wLocation}

#Change4: Removing everything after 'wet'.
ISAY=${ISAY[@]/$toBeRemoved/}

# Test code - do not modify
echo "Warren Buffett said:"
echo $BUFFETT
echo "and I say:"
echo $ISAY
